ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Jessica, an incoming junior at UCLA pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

My passion lies in becoming a software engineer, with a keen interest in full-stack web development, particularly in the realm of UI/UX design. I'm driven by the thrill of witnessing the progress of my projects, from their inception to fruition, and thrive on the challenge of starting from scratch and creating meaningful solutions.

I consider myself goal and detail-oriented, always aiming for excellence in my work. I firmly believe that teamwork is the cornerstone of success in any workplace setting. I'm not afraid to ask questions, recognizing that curiosity fuels growth. My commitment to thorough research before embarking on any project ensures a solid foundation, and I thrive when working under pressure, turning challenges into opportunities for innovation.

Feel free to reach outâ€”I'm always up for a great conversation or collaboration. ðŸŒŸ
